# SayaKaya Project Test - Frontend Developer - Pokemon

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

Run `npm install` to install all the package dependencies

To run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

To build the project:

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
# or
pnpm build
```

And then start the production server:

```bash
npm run start
# or
yarn start
# or
pnpm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Bugs and further development

This website still contains many bugs, especially in the data fetching section of the Pokemon List which is caused by several Apollo/client modules not working properly. This can be overcome by finding a suitable version of apollo/client to use on Next JS.

This website can also be developed to have more and more complex filter functions.
